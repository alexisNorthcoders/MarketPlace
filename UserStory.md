   # MVP: 
   - Able to search things

   # All user stories: 
    As a user, I can view a list of available items.
    As a user, I can view a list of items for a particular category.
    As a user, I can list an item to sell.
    As a user, I can order an item.
    As a user, I can delete an item listing if I change my mind. (this user story has been abandoned as the current database doesn't support sold item w seller details and it is wrong to save what the user has sold in the local or to handle this information in the front end build.)
    As a user, I can view which items I have previously ordered.
    As a user, I can add an item to my basket to order later if I am still browsing.
    As a user, I can view which items I have added to my basket.
    As a user, I can remove items from my basket.
    As a user, I can create a new user profile.
